A soon to be early 30s backend dev who tries to avoid javascript, but fails on a weekly basis. 

Let's talk about the ideas for projects, the mythical essence that exist prefectly in a void before users and life comes crashing through. Ideas are easy to find, good ideas less so, but the hardest part is bringing an idea to life without it morphing into something that doesn't do the idea justice. And I would be a fool to try and fight it, so I'll just start coding and see what happens.

Feel free to free to follow this however you want. For something more concrete I'll even add a like button here that counts downwards, because that's what this is all about.

TODO actually make that sad button
